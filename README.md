# Final Project for Python  
**By Li and Dolmatova**

## Introduction  
This project aims to classify dyads as high or low cohesive based on EEG synchrony data collected from a social drumming experiment. The study investigates the relationship between neural activity synchrony and interpersonal cohesion using machine learning models.

## Methods  

### EEG Synchrony  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Sampling rate: 500 Hz.  
  - Tools: MATLAB for signal processing; Python for data reshaping.  
  - Band separation: 5 frequency bands using Butterworth filter.  
  - Segmentation: Time windows of 2s, 4s, 24s, 48s, 60s.  
  - Quality Control: Data from 43 pairs of participants retained after artifact detection.


### Cohesion Scores  
- Cohesion assessed using post-session questionnaires (Likert scale: 1-6).  
- Binary classification:  
  - Low cohesion: â‰¤ 4.5.  
  - High cohesion: > 4.5.

### PCA 
- Test Dataset: smallest (no dissection) and biggest dataset (120 parts).
- Relevant Components: Gamma band, Electrode 7 (C4), electrode 5 (CZ) and electrode 8 (F4).

### Machine Learning Models  

#### SVM Model  
- Dataset: All 5 datasets (2 seconds, 4 seconds, 24 seconds, 48 seconds, 60 seconds time windows and full 4 mins).  
- Techniques: GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, 5-fold cross-validation.

#### CNN Model  
- Dataset: 2-second window segments (120 parts).
- Architecture: 1D CNN with 2 convolutional layers.  
- Techniques: Dropout, batch normalization, early stopping, max pooling.  
- Hyperparameters:  
  - Batch size: 16.  
  - Learning rate: 0.001.  
  - Max Epochs: 50.  
  - Loss function: Binary Cross Entropy.  
  - Optimizer: Adam.  
  - Padding: 1

## Results  

### SVM Model  
- Average F1 Score is 0.75

### CNN Model  
- Average F1 Score =  0.56
- Overfitting

## Discussion  

### Key Challenges  
- Small dataset led to overfitting  
- Imbalance in cohesion labels biased model predictions.  

### PCA Analysis Findings  
- Insights align with studies on motor cortex and sensorimotor integration in social cohesion.

### Future Directions  
- Increase dataset size with more participants.  
- Refine synchrony calculation methods.  
- Focus on PFC, ACC regions, and gamma-band activity in future analyses.
